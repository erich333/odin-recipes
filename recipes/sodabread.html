        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/irish_soda_bread/">
            recipe for Irish Soda Bread</a> from Elise Bauer of Simply Recipes. 
            This bread has a really tasty flavor, and it's also not too hard to make!
            When I make this, I use a cast iron skillet, but it isn't absolutely necessary.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 to 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter, cubed and slightly softened</li>
            <li>1 cup currants or raisins</li>
            <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups buttermilk</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk 4 cups of the flour together with the sugar,
                 salt, and baking soda.
            </li>
            <li>Using your (clean) fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture until 
                it resembles coarse meal. Then add in the currants or raisins.
            </li>                 
            <li>Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Add the beaten egg and 
                buttermilk to the well and mix in with a wooden spoon until the dough is 
                too stiff to stir.
            </li>
            <li><p>Use floured hands to gently gather the dough into a rough ball shape. 
                The dough will be soft and sticky. If it is more like a batter than a dough, 
                add up to 1/2 cup more flour until you have a sticky, shaggy dough.</p>

                <p>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and shape into into a 
                    round loaf. Note that the dough will be a little sticky, and quite shaggy
                     (a little like a shortcake biscuit dough).</p>
                <p>You want to work it just enough so the flour is just moistened and the dough 
                    just barely comes together. Shaggy is good. If you over-work the dough the 
                    bread will end up tough.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Transfer to the oven and bake at 425°F until the bread is golden and the 
                bottom sounds hollow when tapped, about 35 to 45 minutes. (If you use a cast 
                iron pan, it may take a little longer as it takes longer for the pan to heat 
                up than a baking sheet.)</p>
                <p>Check for doneness also by inserting a long, thin skewer into the center. 
                    If it comes out clean, it's done.</p>
                <p><em>Hint 1: If the top is getting too dark while baking, tent the bread with 
                    some aluminum foil.</em></p>
                <p><em>Hint 2: If you use a cast iron skillet to cook the bread in the oven, 
                    be very careful when you take the pan out. It's easy to forget that the 
                    handle is extremely hot. Be sure to put a pot holder over it.</em></p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Remove the pan or sheet from the oven, and let the bread sit in the pan 
                or on the sheet for 5 to 10 minutes. Then, remove to a rack to cool briefly.</p>
            <p>Serve the bread warm, at room temperature, or sliced and toasted. Best when 
                eaten warm and just baked.</p></li>
